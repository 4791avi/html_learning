# HTML SESSION OF LEARNING

## What is HTML?
> HTML provides a way of disaplaying web pages with test and images or multimedia content. HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language. An HTML file is a text file containing small markup tags.The markup tags tell the Web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, how to display the page. An HTML file must have an htm or html file extension. HTML stands for Hyper > Text Markup LAnguage.

##  HTML PAGES ARE OF TWO TYPES:
```
> - STATIC PAGES 

> - DYNAMIC PAGES 
```
 > **Static Pages** - Static Pages, as the name indicates, comprise static content (text and images). 'So you can only see the contents of a web page without being able to have interaction  >  with it

> **Dynamic Pages** - Dynamic pages are those where the content of the web page depend on user input. So interaction with the user is required in order to display the web pages. For example, consider a web page which requires a number to be entered from the user in order to find out if it is even or odd. When the user enters the number and clicks on the appropriate button, the number is sent to the web server, which in turn returns the result to the user in an HTML page.

## Tags and Elements
  > **Tags** - A tag is a bit of text that acts as a point demarcation. To create a tag, HTML gives certain characters special meaning: the angel brackets < and >. <br />
  Putting characters within angle brackets creates > a tag. <br />

> **There are two tags:** <br/>
Start tag or opening tag and End tag or closing tag. An end tag always matches a start tag, expect that it has an extra forward slash after after the opening angle bracket.

```html
 <h1> A heading </h1>
```
  > **Elements** - The combination of a start and tags define an element. Everything between the two tags is referred to as the contents of the elements <br />
